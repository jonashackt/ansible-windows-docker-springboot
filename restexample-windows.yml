  tasks:
  ###### Preparation steps
  - name: Create directory C:\spring-boot\spring_boot_app_name, if not there
    win_file: path={{spring_boot_app_path}} state=directory

  - name: Install Docker via chocolatey
    win_chocolatey:
      name: docker

  - name: Install Containers natively as Windows Feature
    win_feature:
      name: containers
      state: present

  ###### Stop services, if they´re already in place
  - name: Stop Spring Boot service, if there - so we can extract JRE & other necessary files without Windows file handle problems
    win_service:
      name: "{{spring_boot_app_name}}"
      state: stopped
    ignore_errors: yes

  ###### Extraction and copying of all necessary files (unzip or install JRE, deploy Spring Boot jar)
  - name: Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 via chocolatey
    win_chocolatey:
      name: jre8

  - name: Copy Spring Boot app´s jar-File to directory C:\spring-boot\spring_boot_app_name
    win_copy:
      src: "{{spring_boot_app_jar}}"
      dest: "{{spring_boot_app_path}}\\{{spring_boot_app_name}}.jar"

  ####### Service installation
  # (stopping and configuration of Application directory is only done for demontration purposes - for apps that need certain .dlls on the path for example)
  - name: Install Spring Boot app as Windows service (via nssm), if not already there - but remain stopped to configure Application directory
    win_nssm:
      name: "{{spring_boot_app_name}}"
      application: "{{path_to_java_exe}}"
      app_parameters:
          "-jar": "{{spring_boot_app_path}}\\{{spring_boot_app_name}}.jar"
      state: stopped

  ####### Configure Application path & Fire up the service
  # If you need to have certain .exe or .dll files on the path where your Spring Boot .jar is located, you can configure the nssm Application Directory to that path
  # this is currently not supported by the ansible win_nssm module http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/win_nssm_module.html, so we have to use raw component
  # After that we have to (re-) start our nssm service to bring the configuration change to life
  - name: Set the Application path for the Spring Boot app to the folder where the needed native libraries reside
    raw: nssm set {{spring_boot_app_name}} AppDirectory {{spring_boot_app_path}}

  - name: Fire up Spring Boot app Windows service
    win_service:
      name: "{{spring_boot_app_name}}"
      state: restarted

  ###### Smoke test, if app has booted up correctly
  - name: Wait until our Spring Boot app is up & running
